# Ollama Batch Cluster

The code in this repository will allow you to batch process a large number of LLM prompts across one or more Ollama servers concurrently and centrally collect all the responses. 

This project started after I tried to get Ollama to make full use of a system with four Nvidia L40S GPUs but failed. I adjusted the *OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL* and *OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD* environment variables, and while it was now using all four GPUs, it was only pushing each GPU to about 25% utilization, so it didn't run any faster than if I had only had one GPU. I then ran four independent Ollama servers, each one pinned to different GPU using the *CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES* variable, and created a script to load balance prompts across the Ollama servers and GPUs. After a bunch of testing and refinement I ended up with the system I've shared in this repo. For a larger test, I spun up Ollama servers on six more servers, each with 4 L40S GPUs for a total of 28 GPUs and 1.344TB of VRAM. It worked perfectly. I know that vLLM is probably a better option for performance than Ollama, but I really like Ollama and it makes this very simple. I'll be spending more time with vLLM soon. I as able to use this setup to keep all 28 GPUs over 90% utilized for over 24 hours to stress test new GPUs before they went into production (one GPU kept failing with double bit errors and needed to be replaced).

The following sections will show you how to use the code in this repo to set this up and use it to run batch jobs against any number of GPUs/servers.

These instructions assume that you are already know how to install/use Ollama, are familiar with editing files, and running scripts. If you are new to Ollama and what to learn how to use it, see [my article](https://medium.com/p/913e50d6b7f0/) which covers the basics. 

## Starting the Ollama servers

The first thing we'll need to do is start up the Ollama servers, one per GPU. If you only have one GPU, or one GPU per multiple servers, and Ollama is already running, you probably don't need to this. To start the Ollama servers, one per GPU, we are going to use the provided [*ollama-batch-servers.sh*](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/ollama-batch-servers.sh) shell script. It takes a single integer argument which indicates the number of GPUs in the system you want to use.

**Usage:**

```bash
chmod +x ollama-batch-servers
./ollama-batch-servers.sh <number of gpus>
```

**Example on a system with 4 GPUs**:

## Preparing your prompts

Next, you'll need to create a *JSONL* formatted file, with a single prompt per line. The following is an example:

```JSON
{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the reasons behind the collapse of the Western Roman Empire."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How did Roman architecture influence urban development in Europe?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Compare and contrast the political systems of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Discuss the role of religion in the daily life of Roman citizens and its impact on the Empire."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Evaluate the effects of Roman conquest on the cultures of the conquered territories."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How did the Roman Empire maintain control over such a vast territory?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Examine the relationship between the Roman Senate and the Emperor."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What technological innovations did the Romans contribute to modern society?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the role of the Roman economy in sustaining the empire’s growth and stability."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Describe the causes and consequences of the Roman Empire's split into Eastern and Western regions."}
```

## Configuring the batch client

The configuration file is a TOML formatted file that includes the LLM model to use, the list of Ollama instances to run the prompts against, and the system message to provide the LLM that will determine how it responds to the prompts. Here is an example configuration file for a setup with 4 servers, each with 2 GPUs:

```TOML
model = "llama3.2"
system_message = """You are an alien that can only respond with strings of emoji characters to convey your answer."""

[ollama_instances]
#format: "hostname:port" = GPU index
"server1:11432" = 0
"server1:11433" = 1
"server2:11432" = 0
"server2:11433" = 1
"server3:11432" = 0
"server3:11433" = 1
"server4:11432" = 0
"server4:11433" = 1
```

If you are running this on your laptop with the single standard Ollama process running on the default port, your configuration file should look like this:

```TOML
model = "llama3.2"
system_message = """You are an alien that can only respond with strings of emoji characters to convey your answer."""

[ollama_instances]
"127.0.0.1:11434" = 0
```

## Running a batch job

Now that we have our servers running, prompts prepared and a configuration file, it's time to process the prompts across the cluster of hosts and GPUs. To do that we'll use the provided [*ollama-batch-process.py*](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/response-printer.py). But first we'll need to install the required dependencies, the *ollama* and *toml* modules:

```bash
pip install ollama toml
```

The following is the usage documentation for the client:

```bash
usage: ollama-batch-process.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] --prompts PROMPTS [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR]

Ollama Batch Processing Client

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG       Path to the configuration TOML file
  --prompts PROMPTS     Path to the JSONL file with prompts
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to save the response JSON files
```

Example running submitting a batch or prompts for processing:

![ollama batch process example](images/ollama-batch-process-example.png)

In the example below, over two minutes (121 seconds) of work for a single GPU was completed in just 9 seconds, which is 13.5x faster than if it was run serially on a single GPU.

# [IMPORTANT] Terminating the server
We finally terminate the ollama server we started by this command to free memory. Note that manually quiting UI Ollama will not affect this server.
```bash
pkill ollama
```

# Collecting the responses 

The responses from each prompt will be written to the designated output directory (or the 'responses' directory if an output directory name wasn't provided) in JSON format, with a file per prompt. The name of the files are the Unix epoch time followed by a random element to avoid collision (example: *1732121830-4358.json*). The output data files include the prompt and response pair.

Example output file contents:

```JSON
{
    "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
    "response": "The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight more than longer wavelengths like red."
}
```

If you what to combine all the responses into a single output, the provided [*response-printer.py*](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/response-printer.py) script will merge the responses into a single output. 

Usage:

```
python response-printer <directory of response JSON files>
```

The following is an example of the combined responses using emoji output to keep it short:

```
########################################
# File: 1732088793-9394.json
########################################
Prompt:
Discuss the influence of Roman culture on the development of Western civilization.

Response:
🏯💫🔥📚💡👑🤴🏻💪🌎️🕊️👸💃🏻🕺😍

########################################
# File: 1732088814-4841.json
########################################
Prompt:

Response:
🏛️🔒💪🚣‍♂️🌄📜👑💼

########################################
# File: 1732121810-9808.json
########################################
Prompt:

```

# Batch Data Extraction

***Note: the clinical notes in this section are synthetic and contains no PII or PHI***

In the example above it just provided an unstructured text (emojis actually 😀), but you can also use this method to extract and combine structured data such as JSON out of a batch of unstructured inputs. In this example, we'll take a bunch of unstructured clinic visit notes, process them batch style across multiple GPUS (it would also work is a single GPU, just much slower) that will extract data into a defined data structure (defined in the system message located in the configuration file) which will result in a json file per clinic note in the designated directory. We'll then use a provided script to merge those data files into a single json document. The resulting data could be imported into database a records, or a parquet file in a data lake, etc.

All the files (input and example outputs) in this example are provided in the [data-extraction-example](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/tree/main/data-extraction-example) director of this repo.

**Configuration**

First we'll need to create our configuration file that provides a system prompt to tell the LLM how to behave and the resulting data structure we want to conform the extracted data to. In this example we are using the 32b version of [Qwen2.5](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5) model. This model is good at following instructions and handling JSON, use a smaller model as needed to fit the VRAM capacity of your GPUs 

***Config file:*** [clinical-notes-config.toml](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/data-extraction-example/clinical-notes-config.toml)

```toml
model = "qwen2.5:32b"
system_message = """
Your task is to extract structured data from unstructured clinical notes. For each input, you must extract the following fields if present and respond only with a JSON object in the exact format below. Do not provide any other responses or comments.
{
  "mrn": "",
  "patient_name": "",
  "age": 0,
  "sex": "",
  "visit_date": "",
  "reason_for_visit": "",
  "diagnosis": "",
  "medications": []
}
If a field is not present in the input, leave it empty or as an empty array ("[]" for "medications").
Only respond with the JSON object, nothing else.
"""

# two servers, each with 2 L40S GPUs:
[ollama_instances]
"gpu-server1:11432" = 0
"gpu-server1:11433" = 1
"gpu-server2:11434" = 0
"gpu-server2:11435" = 1
```

**Data Preparation**

Next take your collection of data and put them in the required JSONL format. Below is a sample of the contents of the provided [clinical-notes.jsonl](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/data-extraction-example/clinical-notes.jsonl) data file.

```

**Run the batch data extraction**

With the source data and configuration in place, we are now ready to run the data extraction job. Execute the following command:

```bash
python ollama-batch-process.py --prompts clinical-notes.jsonl --config clinical-notes-config.toml --output_dir clinical_notes_data
```

**Collect the Output Data**

After the process is complete, you should have a directory filled with multiple JSON files. The following is the contents of one output files that contains the original clinical note (prompt field) and the resulting structured data (response field):

```JSON
{
    "prompt": "Patient: John Doe (MRN: 123456), a 45-year-old male, visited the clinic on 03/15/2023 complaining of severe chest pain that started a few hours prior. He was diagnosed with angina following an ECG and blood tests. He was prescribed aspirin and nitroglycerin for management and advised to follow up in two weeks.",
    "response": "{\n  \"mrn\": \"123456\",\n  \"patient_name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"age\": 45,\n  \"sex\": \"male\",\n  \"visit_date\": \"03/15/2023\",\n  \"reason_for_visit\": \"severe chest pain that started a few hours prior\",\n  \"diagnosis\": \"angina\",\n  \"medications\": [\"aspirin\", \"nitroglycerin\"]\n}"
}
```

***Merging the Results***

If you want to converge the data of all output JSON files into a single JSON file, you can use the provided [response-json-merge.py](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/response-json-merge.py) script.

```bash
python response-json-merge.py --input-dir clinical_notes_data --output-file clinical_notes_data.json
```

After merging the output data the [file](https://github.com/robert-mcdermott/ollama-batch-cluster/blob/main/data-extraction-example/clinical_notes_data.json) will look like this extract below: 


```JSON
  [{
    "mrn": "678234",
    "patient_name": "William Roberts",
    "age": 50,
    "sex": "male",
    "visit_date": "06/20/2023",
    "reason_for_visit": "joint pain and swelling in his fingers",
    "diagnosis": "rheumatoid arthritis",
    "medications": [
      "Methotrexate"
    ]
  },
  {
    "mrn": "667890",
    "patient_name": "Maria Gonzalez",
    "age": 58,
    "sex": "female",
    "visit_date": "11/05/2023",
    "reason_for_visit": "follow-up on her diabetes",
    "diagnosis": "diabetes",
    "medications": [
      "metformin",
      "glipizide"
    ]
  },
  {
    "mrn": "123456",
    "patient_name": "John Doe",
    "age": 45,
    "sex": "male",
    "visit_date": "03/15/2023",
    "reason_for_visit": "severe chest pain that started a few hours prior",
    "diagnosis": "angina",
    "medications": [
      "aspirin",
      "nitroglycerin"
    ]
  }]
```

Now that you have clean, structured data, you can process it via an ETL pipeline to insert it into a database, or convert to a parquet file or similar to ingest by a data lake.
